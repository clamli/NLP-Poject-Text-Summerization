       "[\"UK economy facing 'major risks '  The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face `` serious challenges '' over the next two years , the British Chamber of Commerce ( BCC ) has said .  The group 's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years . The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern . However , the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced `` major risks '' and warned that growth is set to slow . It recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3 % in 2004 to a little below 2.5 % in both 2005 and 2006 .  Manufacturers ' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter , the survey of 5,196 firms found . Employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year .  `` Despite some positive news for the export sector , there are worrying signs for manufacturing , '' the BCC said . `` These results reinforce our concern over the sector 's persistent inability to sustain recovery . '' The outlook for the service sector was `` uncertain '' despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter , the BCC noted .  The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004 . The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence , it said . The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year . But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output . `` The pressure on costs and margins , the relentless increase in regulations , and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems , '' BCC director general David Frost said . `` While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months , it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack .

       "[Musicians to tackle US red tape Musicians ' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts ' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic . A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $ 1,300 ( £680 ) simply for obtaining a visa . Groups including the Musicians ' Union are calling for an end to the `` raw deal '' faced by British performers . US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes . Nigel McCune from the Musicians ' Union said British musicians are `` disadvantaged '' compared to their US counterparts . A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf , which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages , while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists . `` If you make a mistake on your form , you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career , '' says Mr McCune . `` The US is the world 's biggest music market , which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy , '' says Mr McCune . `` The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US , '' he added . The Musicians ' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers ' Forum ( MMF ) , who say British artists face `` an uphill struggle '' to succeed in the US , thanks to the tough visa requirements , which are also seen as impractical . The MMF 's general secretary James Seller said : `` Imagine if you were an orchestra from the Orkneys ? Every member would have to travel to London to have their visas processed . '' `` The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success , and we 're still going to fight to get in there . `` It 's still very important , but there are other markets like Europe , India and China , '' added Mr Seller . A Department for Media , Culture and Sport spokeswoman said : `` We 're aware that people are experiencing problems , and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it . '' A US Embassy spokesman said : `` We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily . '' `` We are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that , '' he added . => Nigel McCune from the Musicians ' Union said British musicians are `` disadvantaged '' compared to their US counterparts.A US Embassy spokesman said : `` We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily . `` The Musicians ' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers ' Forum ( MMF ) , who say British artists face `` an uphill struggle '' to succeed in the US , thanks to the tough visa requirements , which are also seen as impractical.Musicians ' groups are to tackle US visa regulations which are blamed for hindering British acts ' chances of succeeding across the Atlantic . `` The US is the world 's biggest music market , which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy , '' says Mr McCune . `` The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US , '' he added.A singer hoping to perform in the US can expect to pay $ 1,300 ( £680 ) simply for obtaining a visa .\n",
