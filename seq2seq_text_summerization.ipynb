He said Brown was arrested at his hotel after the show at the Great American Music Hall but released without charge . San Francisco police said they could find no record of his arrest . Mr Smernicki said he had been told a fan `` rugby-tackled '' the singer during the gig , which resulted in `` pushing and shoving '' .

The star went off for 15 minutes before returning to finish his set . Police took witness statements and apprehended Brown at his hotel , Mr Smernicki said . But he was released without charge and `` as far as we 're aware , that 's the end of it '' , Mr Smernicki added . A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department said he may have been detained but they could find no record of the incident . Brown , 42 , was lead singer with The Stone Roses , one of the most seminal bands in British rock , until they split in 1996 . He has since forged a successful solo career , scoring nine UK top 30 singles since 1998 . In 1998 , he was sentenced to four months in jail for using threatening behaviour towards an aeroplane captain and stewardess .\",\n",

Joshua Reynolds : The Creation of Celebrity will feature prints , caricatures , and sculpture by the 18th Century artist , who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day . Portrait of Omai fetched the second highest amount for a British painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001 . It was bought by a London dealer who sold it on to a collector . The unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country , but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance .  In March 2004 , the Tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since . The portrait is of a young man who was dubbed `` the noble savage '' when he arrived in London from Polynesia .

The first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in Vienna on Saturday . Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic set in the Alpine country . But despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time , it is barely known inside Austria .  The film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s . The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938 .  Sensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria 's reluctance to embrace the musical . Another source of irritation for Austrians is the song Edelweiss , which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers . The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein . Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria , including yodelling , goat-herds and lederhosen . The production is being staged at a Viennese opera house , the Volksoper , beginning on Saturday . Maria , the novice nun who falls in love with Baron von Trapp , will be played by Austro-Australian actress and singer Sandra Pires .\",\n",

Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007 . News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday , but the stock slipped back 7 % during Monday morning .

The football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its Westfalen stadium . Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend . Three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week . On 14 March , one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club 's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan .

The Pensions Policy Institute ( PPI ) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated .

But if measured at age 65 instead , the PPI said , a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years . The PPI 's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy .  The government has ruled out raising the state pension age , because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies . Chris Curry , PPI research director , said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged . `` Even people in social class V [ unskilled manual workers ] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age , '' he said .

The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected , as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect . But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market . `` There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand , '' said Frank-Juergen Weise , head of the Federal Labour Agency , in a statement . `` But growth of 0.1 % ... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market .

With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years , the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda . A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work , paid for by cutting some cherished benefits , has sparked anger among some German workers . Strikes in a number of industries , notably among the country 's iconic carmakers , have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold . Among the new initiatives are the so-called `` one-euro jobs '' which top up unemployment benefit . The scheme 's formal launch is January , but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics , economists said . `` The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise , '' said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank . `` Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers .

President Viktor Yushchenko , elected in December , is planning to revisit many of Ukraine 's recent privatisations . Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration .  On Wednesday , Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed .  Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises . More than 90,000 businesses in all , from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts , have been sold off since 1992 , as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled . Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list , so as to preserve investor confidence .  Thursday 's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale . The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk , son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma , and Rinat Akhmetov , the country 's richest man . The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether , opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold . Mr Yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $ 3bn . One of the foreign bidders who lost out , steel giant LNM , told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale .\",\n",

That triggered the second successive monthly fall in the CIPS employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since June 2003 . The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam . `` It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again , '' said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva . `` You have weakness in manufacturing , which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England .

Among the biggest laggards , according to the report , are Greece and Italy . The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce . It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development , while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels . Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU , the plan was for Europe to become the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .

The 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat . The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright . But Gianni Agnelli , the godfather of the group , wanted to keep control , and preferred GM 's offer to buy a 20 % stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future , known as a `` put option '' .

The UK 's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems , industrial action and `` operating flaws '' at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes . The South Yorkshire company , led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler , said it hoped to return to profit in 2006 . In early trade on Thursday , its shares were down 10 % at 119 pence . UK Coal said it was making `` significant progress '' in shaking up the business . It had introduced new wage structures , a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions . The company said these actions should `` significantly uplift earnings '' . It expected 2005 to be a `` transitional year '' and to return to profitability in 2006 .  The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold , it said . Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule , UK Coal said , but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule . `` We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues . We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made , '' said Mr Spindler .

The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2 % expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe 's biggest economy . The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6 % , after a year of contraction in 2003 , down from an earlier estimate of 1.7 % . It said growth in the third quarter had been zero , putting the economy at a standstill from July onward .

Major companies including Volkswagen , DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs . According to the statistics office , Destatis , rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand .  But the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of German products overseas . The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole , as well as Germany . Eurozone interest rates are at 2 % , but senior officials at the rate-setting European Central Bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation , prompting fears that interest rates may rise .

The bill , proposed in 1993 , has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva . The old law , dating from 1945 , gave priority first to workers , second to tax revenue and finally to creditors . The new legislation changes this , giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers . The new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary , which is currently $ 94 . The law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy . However , when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out .  The proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties , including Mr Lula 's Worker Party . They considered that they undermined workers ' rights . But President Lula became a defender of the reforms , arguing that the country 's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy . According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine , the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds .

The price of butane gas , a vital fuel for cooking , has risen to 200 dinars ( $ 2.77 ) per canister from 170 dinars . Even before the hike , failing economic conditions had been fanning resentment in some of Algeria 's poorest regions .  Demonstrators took to the streets last week when the cost change was first announced , but police seemed to have restored order . According to local press reports , trouble flared up again on Saturday and carried on into Sunday . El Watan said that a number of hot spots centred on the villages and towns close to Bouira , about 100 kilometres ( 60 miles ) south of the capital Algiers . Among the other main areas affected were the western Tiaret region and Sidi Ammar in the east of the country , Agence France Presse ( AFP ) reported .

But the figures , along with this week 's inflation report , could trigger another interest rate rise in the New Year . However , recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2 % slip in High Street sales during November .  The ONS data confounded analyst expectations . Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December . However , retailers ' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November 's unexpected rise in sales , they say . Aggressive tactics , such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks & Spencer , appear to have paid off . `` Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales has n't grown as much as volumes , '' said Investec economist David Page . The figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked .\",\n",

He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions . Parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time . Under Italian law , administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency , if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble . The firm also said it is preparing further law suits .  According to the Reuters news agency , 35 of the companies sued on Thursday are Italian while the remaining 10 are international . The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions . Among those already targeted are Bank of America , UBS , Credit Suisse First Boston , Deutsche Bank and Citigroup . It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton . They have all denied any wrongdoing . Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist . In the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company , among other things , had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet . That enabled Parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas , allowing it to become a darling of the Italian stock exchange .',\n",

The Securities & Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using techniques that `` did not comply in material respects '' with accounting standards . Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect . The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by $ 5bn ( £2.6bn ) last year after a probe of its books . The SEC 's comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .  The two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market , financing nearly half of all American house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments . The investigation of Freddie Mac in June 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , the industry 's main regulator . Having been pricked into action , the OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on . The SEC found similar problems . The watchdog 's chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen said that `` Fannie Mae 's methodology of assessing , measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported '' by generally accepted accounting principles .\",\n",

Throughout 2004 , the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971 .  The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive .

Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing Hoodia extract . Phytopharm shares jumped 10.7 % on the news , with analysts saying sales of $ 600m ( £309m ) a year were possible . The plant , licensed to Phytopharm in 1997 , has been used for thousands of years by the Sans bushmen of the Kalahari desert to stave off hunger . Studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products .  Phytopharm will receive an initial fee of £6.5m from Unilever - out of a potential total of £21m - as well as future royalties on product sales . Under the deal , production of the Hoodia cactus at Phytopharm 's nursery in South Africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions , said Phytopharm chief executive Richard Dixey . The firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from Hoodia with Pfizer . But the research collaboration came to an end in 2003 . Analysts said Unilever could launch the new products in 2007 . `` This deal goes a long way to restoring the market faith in Phytopharm 's pipeline after the Pfizer exit , '' said analyst Erling Refsum at Nomura .\",\n",

Iran 's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell 's stake in a new mobile network from 70 % to 49 % . The move , which was justified on national security grounds , follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments . Turkcell said the decision `` increases the risks '' attached to the project . Although the company 's statement said it would continue to monitor developments , observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $ 3bn deal . `` The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero , '' said Atinc Ozkan , analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul . If Turkcell does back out , MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running . The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal .  Turkcell 's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble . Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran 's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004 .

Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $ 280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products .

The US telecoms market is consolidating fast , with former long-distance giant AT & T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $ 16bn . MCI exited bankruptcy in April , having gone bust under previous name WorldCom . The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits .  Shareholders lost about $ 180bn when the company collapsed , while 20,000 workers lost their jobs . Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial , accused of overseeing an $ 11bn fraud . Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour , paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $ 250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy .  MCI is the US 's second-biggest long distance firm after AT & T . Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases . A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October . Last week , SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT & T for about $ 16bn . Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI 's global network and business-based subscribers . The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC 's AT & T deal .

Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments , adding that there may be job cuts .  `` The strong growth outlook for Sandoz , which will create jobs , is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force , '' the firm said in a statement . Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals . Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost .  There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented . However , not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal . `` This is a very expensive acquisition , '' Birgit Kuhlhoff , from Sal Oppenheim investment bank , told Reuters . `` I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure .

Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport . The sprinters both sent written explanations to the IAAF , which have been taken into account .

Hoddle has been linked with a return to former club Southampton but Wolves have won the race for his services . He has been out of the game since being sacked at Spurs in September 2003 and worked alongside Wolves caretaker boss Stuart Gray at Southampton . Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job .  His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview . The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton , where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves . He engineered an upturn in Saints ' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player . That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season . Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton . Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday .\",\n",

The 51-year-old premier has marked his 2,838th day in the post , overtaking the combined length of Harold Wilson 's two terms during the 1960s and 1970s . If Mr Blair wins the next election and fulfils his promise to serve a full third term , he will surpass Margaret Thatcher 's 11 years by the end of 2008 . In 1997 , Mr Blair became the youngest premier of the 20th century , when he came to power at the age of 43 .

Mr Blair 's other political firsts include becoming the first Labour leader to win two successive full terms in power after the 2001 Labour landslide . And the birth of the Blairs ' fourth child , Leo , on 20 May , 2000 , was the first child born to a serving prime minister in more than 150 years . The last `` Downing Street dad '' was Lord John Russell in 1848 . Labour won a huge majority of 167 over the Conservatives in 2001 , but Mr Blair has since been criticised by many in his own party .

Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock said the chancellor would be best placed to take over from Mr Blair . When asked about the future leadership of the party , he told ITV Wales ' Waterfront programme : `` That contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the Prime Minister , Tony Blair , decides he 's subscribed all he can and then wants to go . `` I think that the main contender will be Gordon Brown , who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience .

Mr Brown 's trip is designed to highlight how the UK wants to make Africa 's problems a priority of its chairmanship of the G8 this year . He will see an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women 's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town . At slums in Narobi on Wednesday , he said education needs had to be tackled .  Speaking outside the Olympic Primary School , Mr Brown said : `` It is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education . '' He pointed to international plans to invest $ 10bn for education in Africa over the next decade . The school is on the edge of Kibera , where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud , scrap metal and cardboard . Mr Brown 's aides say he wants to find out more about the Kenyan Government 's education policies , which included introducing free primary education in early 2003 . The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two . The trip follows claims of infighting between Mr Brown and Tony Blair detailed in a new book . Conservative leader Michael Howard is expected to seize on those reports at prime minister 's questions at 1200 GMT on Wednesday .\",\n",

New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music , movies and software . The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI . The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $ 250,000 ( £130,000 ) fine .  In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network . The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files . Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers . Users would swap files , such as films and music , by exchanging data over the network . During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies , 40 software programs , 13 games and 178 `` sound recordings '' from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group . The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting `` criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks '' . In total , six raids were carried out in August . Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm .

New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music , movies and software . The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI . The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $ 250,000 ( £130,000 ) fine .  In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network . The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files . Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers . Users would swap files , such as films and music , by exchanging data over the network . During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies , 40 software programs , 13 games and 178 `` sound recordings '' from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group . The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting `` criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks '' . In total , six raids were carried out in August . Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm . The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement . They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage .

       " [\"Windows worm travels with Tetris  Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game .  The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected . While users play the game , the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks . The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild .  The Cellery worm does not spread via e-mail like many other viruses . Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines . When it infects a machine , Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play . As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it . At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines . The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds . Productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing Tetris . PCs running Windows 95 , 98 , ME , NT , 2000 , and XP could be vulnerable to the worm . `` If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office , your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern , '' said Graham Cluley , spokesman for anti-virus firm Sophos . So far the number of people infected by Cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low . Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected .\",\n",

Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue , especially as it relates to the patenting of software . Critics say the law would favour large companies over small , innovative ones . They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software .  Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software . The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US . So , for instance , US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping ' . Critics claim the law , which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US , is little more than a law on ideas . `` Patent rights , it is claimed , protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected , '' Eva Lichtenberg , a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement . `` Smaller , innovative firms can not afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them , '' she added . The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic .

It also plans to develop a `` worldwide entertainment concept '' with the brand , although details are not yet known . The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s .  In the chronology of home computing , Commodore was one of the pioneers .  The Commodore 64 , launched in 1982 , was one of the first affordable home PCs . It was followed a few years later by the Amiga . The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system , even to this day . The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s . Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers . In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari , which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games , formerly known as Infogrames .  Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name , including portable USB storage devices and digital music players . It had planned to relaunch the brand , following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games . Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC , Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run . The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over £17m .\",\n",

IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical , research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use . IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software .  In 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely .

Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks . One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace . Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working . In 2001 it put $ 300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs .

       " [\"US woman sues over cartridges  A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard ( HP ) , saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date .  The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not . The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001 . HP , the world 's biggest printer firm , declined to comment on the lawsuit . HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change .  But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty . `` The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer , '' the suit said . The lawsuit is asking for restitution , damages and other compensation . The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months . The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge , a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year . The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK 's Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) , which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers .\",\n",

BitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers . Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file , which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie , among multiple users at the same time . The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source .

Santy 's spread has now been stopped after Google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims .  The worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program . Soon after being infected , sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpBB software . Once Google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply . A message sent to Finnish security firm F-Secure by Google 's security team said : `` While a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous , we think we can and should do better . '' `` We will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems , '' the Google team said . Security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program .

       " [\"US woman sues over ink cartridges  A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard ( HP ) , saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date .  The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not . The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001 . HP , the world 's biggest printer firm , declined to comment on the lawsuit . HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change .  But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty . `` The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer , '' the suit said . The lawsuit is asking for restitution , damages and other compensation . The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months . The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge , a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year . The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK 's Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) , which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers .\",\n",
